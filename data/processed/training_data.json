Analyze soil conditions, weather data, and recommend the most suitable crop with climate adaptation strategies.\n\n### Input:\nLocation: Farm in tropical/subtropical region\nSoil Analysis:\n- Nitrogen (N): 117 kg/ha\n- Phosphorus (P): 32 kg/ha\n- Potassium (K): 34 kg/ha\n- pH Level: 6.758792552\n\nCurrent Weather:\n- Temperature: 26.2724184\u00b0C\n- Humidity: 52.12739421%\n- Expected Rainfall: 127.1752928mm\n\nQuestion: What crop should I grow for climate resilience?\n\n### Response:\nBased on your comprehensive analysis:\n\n**Recommended Crop: coffee**\n\n**Why this crop:**\n- Optimal for soil nutrients (N:117, P:32, K:34)\n- Thrives at pH 6.758792552\n- Suited for 26.2724184\u00b0C temperature range\n- Requires ~127.1752928mm rainfall (matches your conditions)\n- Humidity tolerance: 52.12739421% is ideal\n\n**Climate Resilience Tips:**\n1. Monitor soil moisture regularly\n2. Use organic mulching to retain moisture\n3. Consider drip irrigation for water efficiency\n4. Rotate with legumes for soil nitrogen restoration\n\nThis crop will help you adapt to climate variability while maintaining productivity."
